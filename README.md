# Artificial Intelligence application, using K Nearest Neighbors. With a dataset as input, this database were images of objects/animals and a unique ID for each category. For example, dogs were 1, trucks were 2, cats were 3, etc. The app was trained with the dataset, and the algorithm identified the element in the image. Given an image of a dog, the app returns the K possible neighbors, looking to return 1(dog) as primary option. All of this was programmed with Python, using Numpy to handle arrays and the operations between arrays.
